# School of Engineering Sciences Web Application


Welcome to the School of Engineering Sciences Web Application, a comprehensive software engineering project developed to streamline and manage various academic processes. This application is designed to enhance the academic experience for students and faculty members alike.

## Introduction
The School of Engineering Sciences Web Application provides a user-friendly platform for students to interact with academic resources, administrators, and faculty members. It aims to simplify tasks such as student registration, course enrollment, fee payment, assignments, projects, exams, and more.

## Technology Stack
Frontend: React, Bootstrap, React Router
Backend: Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
Features
Student Registration: New students can create accounts by providing essential personal information.

Login and Authentication: Registered students can securely log in using their student ID and password.

Student Profile: Students can view and manage their profile information and academic records.

Course List and Registration: Students can browse and register for courses for the semester.
Assignments: Students can view upcoming assignments with their content and due dates. 

Timetable: The application generates individual timetables for students based on their registered courses.

(To be developed) Fees Payment: Students can view their tuition fees and make online payments.

(To be developed) Projects, and Labs: Faculty members can create and manage academic tasks. Structure will be identical to the Assignments feature.

(To be developed) Exams: Students can view exam schedules and access their results securely.

## System Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The frontend, built using React and Bootstrap, serves as the View layer. Spring Boot acts as the Controller, handling HTTP requests and interacting with the PostgreSQL database, which serves as the Model layer.

## Software Process Model
The development of this application followed the Agile Software Development process model, enabling iterative and incremental development, fostering flexibility, and encouraging continuous feedback and improvement.
